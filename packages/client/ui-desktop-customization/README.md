# Desktop customization

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Desktop-only browser plugin for learner-facing visual enhancement, background selection, the visible update center, and the Beyondata attribution badge. The package is mounted only when the Desktop Host exports `DSH_DESKTOP=1`; persistence and update operations cross the fixed Electron preload bridge.

The package ships two named background themes: Whale Maid is the first-run default and Cloud Cat remains selectable. Their stable identifiers are persisted without duplicating bundled images in `userData`. The custom-background path still accepts PNG, JPEG, or WebP up to 16 MB, renders a 1920×1080 WebP locally, persists it under Electron `userData`, and applies ThemeRuntime token overrides. No selected image is uploaded.

The visual-enhancement Settings row and the composer shortcut consume one Host-backed status source. The setup dialog selects Bailian or OpenRouter, keeps Bailian on its fixed `qwen3.8-max` model, and lets an OpenRouter user enter a compatible vision model (default `openai/gpt-4.1-mini`). User-entered keys are stored under application-owned credential references; ambient `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` values remain read-only fallbacks and are never write targets. The shortcut opens the same real-image verification flow while disabled, disables through the same Settings namespace while enabled, and explains the supported image workflow on hover. Host-pushed settings and credential updates refresh both entries together.

## Model Experience

None, as this browser-side package only controls the Host-owned visual capability and registers no model-facing context itself.

#### KV Cache effect

The package itself adds no tokens or KV-cache entries; after this UI enables visual enhancement, the Host-owned capability governs all Skill, Tool, and visual-observation effects.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- The update center performs real checks only in a packaged application. Source development mode reports this boundary explicitly.
- Signed installers, platform release metadata, and release publishing are deferred to the three-platform packaging phase.
